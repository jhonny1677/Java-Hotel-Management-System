**Test Concurrent Booking System:**
1. Go to **Bookings** tab
2. Enter room number: `101`
3. Set dates: `2024-01-15` to `2024-01-17`
4. Click **"Book Room (Async)"**
5. Observe async processing in system output

**Expected Behavior:**
- ✅ Lock-based room reservation
- ✅ Async payment processing
- ✅ Real-time status updates
- ✅ Prevents double-booking

---

### 4. **Dynamic Pricing Engine**

**Test Advanced Pricing Algorithms:**
1. Go to **Dynamic Pricing** tab
2. Enter room: `101`
3. Try different date ranges:
   - **Weekend dates** (higher prices)
   - **Summer months** (seasonal pricing)
   - **Long stays** (discounts)
4. Click **"Calculate Dynamic Price"**

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ 4 pricing strategies applied
- ✅ Detailed breakdown showing multipliers
- ✅ Seasonal, demand-based, and day-of-week adjustments
- ✅ Length-of-stay discounts

---

### 5. **Revenue Analytics & Business Intelligence**

**Test Enterprise Analytics:** (Admin/Staff only)
1. Go to **Analytics** tab
2. Click each button:
   - **"Generate Revenue Report"** → ADR, RevPAR, occupancy rates
   - **"Analytics Dashboard"** → Real-time KPIs
   - **"30-Day Forecast"** → Predictive analytics
   - **"Executive Summary"** → Business insights

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Professional revenue metrics (ADR, RevPAR)
- ✅ Occupancy rate calculations
- ✅ Top-performing rooms analysis
- ✅ Forecasting with seasonal adjustments

---

### 6. **Payment Gateway Integration**

**Test Multi-Gateway Payment System:** (Admin/Staff only)
1. Go to **Payments** tab
2. Click **"Gateway Status"**
3. Verify Stripe and PayPal gateway health
4. Click **"Total Revenue"** for financial overview

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Multiple payment gateway support
- ✅ Automatic failover capabilities
- ✅ Health monitoring and status tracking
- ✅ Revenue and refund calculations

---

### 7. **Caching Layer & Performance**

**Test Redis-like Caching System:** (Admin/Staff only)
1. Go to **System** tab
2. Click **"Cache Statistics"**
3. Go to **Rooms** tab and refresh multiple times
4. Return to System tab and check cache stats

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ In-memory caching with TTL
- ✅ Cache hit/miss tracking
- ✅ Intelligent cache invalidation
- ✅ Performance optimization

---

### 8. **Command Pattern & Undo Operations**

**Test Undo Functionality:** (Admin/Staff only)
1. Create a booking in **Bookings** tab
2. Go to **System** tab
3. Click **"Undo Last Booking"**
4. Verify booking was reversed

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Command history tracking
- ✅ Reliable undo operations
- ✅ State consistency maintenance

---

### 9. **Observer Pattern & Real-time Updates**

**Test Event-Driven Architecture:**
1. Create or cancel bookings
2. Watch **System Output** panel
3. Observe real-time notifications

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Automatic room availability alerts
- ✅ Booking status notifications
- ✅ Event-driven system updates
- ✅ Decoupled component communication

---

### 10. **Factory Pattern & Room Management**

**Test Flexible Room Creation:**
1. Go to **Rooms** tab
2. Click **"Refresh Rooms"**
3. Observe different room types with configurations

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Room types: Single, Double, Suite, Deluxe, Presidential
- ✅ Type-specific amenities
- ✅ Flexible room configurations
- ✅ Factory-generated room features

---

## 🔧 Advanced Testing Scenarios

### **Load Testing Simulation**
```java
// Test concurrent booking attempts
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    // Try booking the same room simultaneously
    // Verify only one succeeds due to locking
}
```

### **Pricing Strategy Testing**
```java
// Test different scenarios:
- High occupancy periods → Higher prices
- Off-season dates → Lower prices  
- Long stays → Discounts applied
- Last-minute bookings → Premium pricing
```

### **Error Handling Testing**
```java
// Test system resilience:
- Invalid room numbers
- Conflicting date ranges
- Payment gateway failures
- Network timeout scenarios
```
